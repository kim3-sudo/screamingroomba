Tools Needed
************

Required
^^^^^^^^

- Scissors
- Precision screwdriver kit (we recommend `iFixit's Pro Tech Toolkit <https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-307>`_)
- Wire strippers
- Side cutters
- Soldering iron (and all accessories, like solder, helping hands, fume extractor, heat shrink, etc.)
- Your own private wireless network (you can just use a regular wireless router)
- A computer with Internet connectivity and either an Ethernet port or WiFi capabilities (to connect to your private network)
- A SD card reader (your computer might have one built-in)
- A USB Type-A to USB Micro-B cable (you'll probably want a short one to cram inside the Roomba housing, but you can also just wrap up a longer cable)
- An external monitor with HDMI input
- A HDMI cable
- A USB (not PS2!) keyboard and mouse

Note: If you are using a keyboard with an integrated USB hub, don't use the hub to connect your mouse. Instead, connect your mouse directly to the Raspberry Pi when you need it.

Note: You only need the SD card reader, monitor, HDMI cable, keyboard, and mouse to configure the Raspberry Pi the first time. Standard operation can (and should) be done over SSH.

Optional
^^^^^^^^

- Digital multimeter or voltmeter (you only need the voltmeter for most measurments)
- Benchtop power supply (variable voltage, up to 18v)
- Power drill
- Zip-ties
- Cleaning wipes (like Clorox or Lysol)
